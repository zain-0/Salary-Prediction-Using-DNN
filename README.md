# Salary Prediction Neural Network

## Overview

This project involves the development of a neural network model to predict salaries based on various features related to employees' profiles. The dataset used for training and evaluation includes information such as age, past experience, job roles, and more.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing (Notebook 1):**
   - Loading the dataset and initial preprocessing steps.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables.
   - Feature engineering for additional insights.

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization (Notebook 2):**
   - Further analysis and visualizations to unveil patterns and trends.
   - Visualization of the correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.
   - Salary distribution analysis by different units, designations, and gender.

3. **Model Building (Notebook 3):**
   - Building a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
   - Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal model performance.

4. **Evaluation and Metrics (Notebook 4):**
   - Evaluation of the model using mean absolute error (MAE) and other metrics.
   - Interpretation of the results and analysis of model consistency.
